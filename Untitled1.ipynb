    "# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:\n",
    "1. Extract features and train an SVM model on new objects (see `pick_list_*.yaml` in `/pr2_robot/config/` for the list of models you'll be trying to identify). \n",
    "2. Write a ROS node and subscribe to `/pr2/world/points` topic. This topic contains noisy point cloud data that you must work with.\n",
    "3. Use filtering and RANSAC plane fitting to isolate the objects of interest from the rest of the scene.\n",
    "4. Apply Euclidean clustering to create separate clusters for individual items.\n",
    "5. Perform object recognition on these objects and assign them labels (markers in RViz).\n",
    "6. Calculate the centroid (average in x, y and z) of the set of points belonging to that each object.\n",
    "7. Create ROS messages containing the details of each object (name, pick_pose, etc.) and write these messages out to `.yaml` files, one for each of the 3 scenarios (`test1-3.world` in `/pr2_robot/worlds/`).  [See the example `output.yaml` for details on what the output should look like.](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/pr2_robot/config/output.yaml)  \n",
    "8. Submit a link to your GitHub repo for the project or the Python code for your perception pipeline and your output `.yaml` files (3 `.yaml` files, one for each test world).  You must have correctly identified 100% of objects from `pick_list_1.yaml` for `test1.world`, 80% of items from `pick_list_2.yaml` for `test2.world` and 75% of items from `pick_list_3.yaml` in `test3.world`.\n",

    "# Extra Challenges: Complete the Pick & Place\n",
    "7. To create a collision map, publish a point cloud to the `/pr2/3d_map/points` topic and make sure you change the `point_cloud_topic` to `/pr2/3d_map/points` in `sensors.yaml` in the `/pr2_robot/config/` directory. This topic is read by Moveit!, which uses this point cloud input to generate a collision map, allowing the robot to plan its trajectory.  Keep in mind that later when you go to pick up an object, you must first remove it from this point cloud so it is removed from the collision map!\n",
    "8. Rotate the robot to generate collision map of table sides. This can be accomplished by publishing joint angle value(in radians) to `/pr2/world_joint_controller/command`\n",
    "9. Rotate the robot back to its original state.\n",
    "10. Create a ROS Client for the “pick_place_routine” rosservice.  In the required steps above, you already created the messages you need to use this service. Checkout the [PickPlace.srv](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project/tree/master/pr2_robot/srv) file to find out what arguments you must pass to this service.\n",
    "11. If everything was done correctly, when you pass the appropriate messages to the `pick_place_routine` service, the selected arm will perform pick and place operation and display trajectory in the RViz window\n",
    "12. Place all the objects from your pick list in their respective dropoff box and you have completed the challenge!\n",
    "13. Looking for a bigger challenge?  Load up the `challenge.world` scenario and see if you can get your perception pipeline working there!\n",

    "The goal of this project is to program a PR2 to identify and acquire target objects from a cluttered space and place them in a bin. The project is based on the Amazon's Robotics Challenge.\n",

    "1. The PR2 robot perceive its environment.\n",
    "2. Identify the objects in the env \n",

    "### Exercise 1, 2 and 3 pipeline implemented\n",
    "#### 1. Complete Exercise 1 steps. Pipeline for filtering and RANSAC plane fitting implemented.\n",
    "The Aim of exercise is to apply some filtering techniques to generate the delibrate point cloud.\n",
    "Step 1: VoxelGrid Downsampling Filter\n",
    "      Downsampling is done to decrease the density/resolution of the pointcloud that is obtained from RGB-D camera. The voxel(volume element) is the cubic element with leaf size(sides). The point cloud is divided into voxels of specific leaf size(I took 0.01) and the spatial average of the points in the cloud is statistically combined into one output point. The increase in voxel adds more detail and processing time.\n",

    "Step 2: Passthrough Filter\n",
    "          The passthrough filter is method for capturing region of interest 3D point cloud along the global cartesian axis. For processing the area in front of the PR2 Robot, I used a range of -0.4 to 0.4 in Y axis and 0.61 to 0.9 in Z axis. \n",

    "Step 3: RANSAC Plane Fitting\n",
    "        Random Sample Consensus(RANSAC) method used to identify the dataset point and classify them as inliers (model with a specified set of parameters) and outliers.\n",

    "#### 2. Complete Exercise 2 steps: Pipeline including clustering for segmentation implemented.  \n",
    "Aim of the exercise is segmentation of point cloud data using color and spatial properties.\n",
    "The exercise explain two clustering technique - 1) K-mean 2) Euclidean Clustering\n",
    "1) K-mean used to cluster object based on the their distance from a randomly chosen centriod. The number of group to be clustered should be predefined. \n",
    "2) Euclidean Clustering (or DBSCAN) is density based spatial cluster of applications with noise. It groups data based on threshold distance from the their nearest neigbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: The conversion of XYZRGB cloud point to XYZ point cloud data to get only spatial data. Although, DBSCAN can be color data, intensity values, or other numerical features and cluster based on other features as well. To decrease the computation, K-dimensional tree is made to search the neigbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: The Euclidean clustering is used to build the individual point cloud for each object. The cluster-mask point cloud allows each cluster to be visualized separately.\n",

    "Aim of the this exercise is to extract feartures from the segmented cloud. And recognize the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6:  Capture Object features : The image is convert into HSV from RGB. \n",
    "    The color histograms are used to measure how objects look when capture as image. To give model a more complete understanding the objects are positions in random orientations. The binning sceheme is used for histogram. The number of dins is propotional the detail of each object mapped. The code for histogram is in feature.py and functions compute_color_histograms() and compute_normal_histograms() are defined. In capture_feature edit the model based on the world and pick_list and generate training_set.sav file.\n",

    "Step 7: Train SVM model\n",
    "    A support vector machine is used to train the model. The training_set.sav file generated is used for cross validaion of model (I used 50 fold cross validation). Run the train_svm.py script to train SVM, which will save the model in model.sav file. The train_svm.py produce the normalized confusion matrix and confusion matrix, without normalization. The confusion matrix will depict the accuracy of model. \n",
